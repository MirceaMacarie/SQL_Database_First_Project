## :pushpin: Inspiration and personal purpose :chart_with_upwards_trend:
As a software testing enthusiast, basic knowledge of databases is also necessary. That's why I started studying to get to know this field at an elementary level, which is why I tried to create a personal project that would combine what I learned. The main purpose was to made a Database with customers, products of an online store and the relations between tabels.

## :pushpin: Database Design :art:
The conception and design of the Database was done with the help of DB-Designer. In this application, I created the Database tables, I established the columns, names, data types and the main relationships between the table, through Primary keys and Foreign keys.
