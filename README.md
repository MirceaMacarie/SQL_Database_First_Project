# My First Relational Database (SQL)
This is my first database project, containing a relational database made with MySQL database manager, SQL language and phpMyAdmin client interface. It is inspired by the Introductory SQL Database Course on Udemy that I took.

## :pushpin: Inspiration and personal purpose :chart_with_upwards_trend:
As a software testing enthusiast, basic knowledge of databases is also necessary. That's why I started studying to get to know this field at an elementary level, which is why I tried to create a personal project that would combine what I learned. The main purpose was to made a Database with customers, products of an online store and the relations between tabels.






## :pushpin: Project technologies :computer:
+ **DB Designer** as main online tool to make Database Design
+ **MySQL** as Database Management System (DBMS for relational DB)
+ **SQL** language to structure and made CRUD operations and JOINs
+ **phpMyAdmin** as client interface for MySQL DBMS

## :pushpin: Database Design :art:
The conception and design of the Database was done with the help of DB-Designer. In this application, I created the Database tables, I established the columns, names, data types and the main relationships between the table, through Primary keys and Foreign keys.

## :pushpin: Database Structure :wrench:
As it appears in its design, the Database in my project has 5 tables: Customer, Address, Product, Order_Item and Order. Each table has its own Primary key (5 PKs), being linked between them by Foreign keys (5 FKs).

## :pushpin: CRUD operations and JOINs on Database üñ•Ô∏è
After building the tables in the Database, I started to execute the CRUD and JOIN operations, to learn and practice the fundamental operations in a Database, from phpMyAdmin interface and with SQL commands.
1. CREATE (INSERT)
2. READ (SELECT)
3. UPDATE
4. DELETE
5. JOIN
